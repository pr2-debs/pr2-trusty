#!/bin/sh 

# This is an example script for diskless-booted systems over NFS.
# In order to make the script working properly, you need to adjust
# the parameters below and you also aready need to have booted
# your root environment over NFS, either by an initrd/initramfs
# or by your specific OS NFS-boot method (e.g. see 
# ${path_to_linux_sources}/Documentation/nfsroot.txt).
# Furtheremore, this script expectes your NFS-server to export
# /unionfs/hosts (MUST be read-write) and 
# /unionfs/groups/default (read-only is sufficient).
# You then also MUST have the directory /unionfs/host and
# /unionfs/groups/default with these 
# subdirectories: bin  etc  lib  lib32  root  sbin  usr  var
#
# All of this is only an example, of course, and may be easily changed.
#
# On my systems this script is then executed as the very first init-script,
# thus before any other init script is executed. On debian/ubuntu this
# can be done by copying this script to /etc/init.d/unionfs-fuse and then
# by creating a link /etc/rcS.d/S01a_unionfs-fuse -> ../init.d/unionfs-fuse.
#
# NOTE: It is generally advisable to monitor the very first boot process of 
# a client using a serial cable, SOL (ipmi) or serial netconsole.
