This directory contains the ROS configuration for your robot on cturtle.

Files and their uses are listed below:

/etc/ros/cturtle/setup.sh

 * Sets up the ROS environment.  This is typically a symlinked to from
   /etc/ros/setup.sh

/etc/ros/cturtle/robot.launch

 * This launch file starts the PR2 from scratch.  The launch file is
   just an inclusion of the default pr2 launch files, but if you have
   changes to your robot (e.g. removing and arm or adding a sensor),
   this is the place to put those, and this can be treated like a
   configuration file.  This file typically references
   /etc/ros/cturtle/urdf/robot.xml

/etc/ros/cturtle/urdf/

 * This directory contains calibrated and uncalibrated
   cturtle-specific URDFs.  /etc/ros/cturtle/urdf/robot.xml
   is loaded by default from robot.launch.
